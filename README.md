# Stock-Price-Percent-Return-Prediction
This project aims to predict the stock price and percent return of the S&amp;P 500 companies, which uses a multiple linear regression model to make the prediction. The model is based on the historical trends and correlation between companies' Wikipedia page views and their stock price. All data are requested through the Nasdaq API and Wikipedia API.

## Sample correlation between Wikipedia page views and company stock:
